/**
 * Run this fixture's Lambdas at the HOST's CPU architecture.
 *
 * A function that declares no `architecture` defaults to `X86_64`, so on an
 * arm64 host cdk-local pins `--platform linux/amd64` and every container here
 * runs under CPU emulation -- where the Go RIE in the `public.ecr.aws/lambda/*`
 * base images faults intermittently, at a different assertion on every run
 * (issue #560; extended to the remaining fixtures by issue #569).
 *
 * Declaring the HOST arch -- rather than hardcoding either value -- is what
 * makes the container native on an Apple Silicon dev host AND on an x86_64 CI
 * runner, instead of trading one host's emulation for the other's. Keep it on
 * every function here: a new handler that omits it silently reintroduces the
 * arm64-only flake. The full rationale, the carve-outs, and the fence that
 * enforces this live in `tests/unit/integ-fixture-host-architecture.test.ts`.
