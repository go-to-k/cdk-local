# PreToolUse hook. Blocks `gh pr create` and `gh pr merge` (including
# --auto) unless the `verify-pr` markgate marker is fresh for the
# current content state. The gate's scope (see .markgate.yml) is the
# AND of the `check` and `docs` child gates plus the /verify-pr
# skill's own work — so editing any code/test/doc path invalidates
# the marker and forces a successful /verify-pr run before the PR
# can be opened or merged.
#
# This is the structural enforcement of the "PR readiness checklist"
# rule: live-test the changed behavior, walk all shared-utility
# callers, refresh PR title + body, and run the session retrospective
# (proposing new rules/hooks/skills for recurring patterns) BEFORE
# `gh pr create` / `gh pr merge`. The skill said it; the hook
# enforces it.
#
# WHY cwd-aware resolution: this repo is regularly worked in via
# `git worktree`, and markgate stores marker state per-worktree at
# `<git rev-parse --absolute-git-dir>/markgate/`. We resolve the
# target working tree from the PreToolUse payload's `cwd` field +
# preceding `cd <path>` segments + the last `gh -C <path>` flag, so the markgate
# verify runs against the worktree the PR will actually open / merge
# from. Convention: set markers from the worktree you intend to open
# the PR (and merge it) from.

# Shared, segment-aware command matching (go-to-k/cdk-local#541). Sourcing it
# gives this gate `gate_matches`, `gate_target_dir`, and the GATE_RE_* verb
# regexes every gate now spells the same way.
# Fail CLOSED if the shared matcher is missing or does not load: a gate that
# cannot decide must not wave the command through. `[ -r … ] || exit 0` was the
# first shape here, and it silently disabled the gate whenever the library was
# unreadable or truncated — with the sibling gates' own comments claiming the
# opposite (go-to-k/cdkd#2130 review). The `declare -F` check catches a partial
# source, where `.` succeeds but the function is missing.

Required action — no exceptions:
  /verify-pr [PR-number]

The skill walks the full PR-readiness checklist:
  - typecheck / lint / build / unit tests / vp run test:hooks
  - test coverage for the diff
  - CI status / working tree / docs consistency
  - Docker + integ marker verification (for src/** or tests/integration/** touches)
  - code review (incl. shared-utility caller verification)
  - live-test the changed behavior against real or fixture input
  - retrospective + proposals for new rules / hooks / skills
  - residual review-nit sweep + auto-close audit
  - PR title + body freshness vs the actual diff

It is the ONLY legitimate setter of this marker. Do NOT call
`markgate set verify-pr` directly from a shell to bypass this hook —
the whole point of the gate is that an unverified PR cannot be opened
or merged. If a check legitimately cannot pass right now (e.g. no
Docker daemon for live-test), say so explicitly in the report; the
gate stays red so a human can decide whether to override.
